# Desktop-Assistant-Python
A Python app running in the terminal using LLaMa-2 to answer questions.

To run this successfully you will need to download some files. 
- First, you will need to download the model you want. A complete list can be found at https://gpt4all.io/index.html. Make sure to put the file in a folder named gpt4all (it will be created when you download GPT4All) and will be located in a folder named .cache. Alternatively, you could specify the file path for the model.
- Next, you will need to install the modules. They will be listed at the top of the code. Use pip.
- Specify your max token count. Usually, 2048 is enough.
- Make sure you use proper grammar as the assistant may generate bad responses otherwise.
- Compile and enjoy!
